# lorebooks
# by Dokimi

A Minetest mod that adds lore books, to allow story telling within a Minetest universe.

These books contain short stories, poems, religious decrees, official pronouncements... anything at all.

These books can be used to tell fictional tales, or fictionalized versions of real peoples interactions with the Minetest game, and the Minetest community. The aim is for these books to create a Minetest Universe, to add a sense of narrative to playing Minetest, as well as to capture the stories and culture of the Minetest community.

The idea is for many different people to add their stories to this collection. e.g. histories of servers, histories of people, stories about the creation and use of mods, notable places, buildings etc etc.

See the init.lua file in lorebooks for formatting guides etc to aid with adding your story to the collection.




# The mods:

- Lorebooks: The collection of books. They can only be accessed in creative mode (or crafted if you already have a copy).
- trm_lorebooks: Registers the books with the Treasury mod. Allows books to be spawned in the world provided you have Treasury spawning mods (see the Treasury mod for details).
