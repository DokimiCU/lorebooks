We would sit on a tropical beach, compose sonnets. That is not what happened.\n \n First - No Yan Flu. Never mind I said.\n \nThe trees will be my friends. I said that. What a fool!\n \n We arrived by boat. As soon as I saw the land... the trees! Were they trees? Beasts? Robots? The handiwork of a madman. They were enormous. A vast verdant mountain of foliage.\n \nI was astounded at that, but when we landed - they moved! The trees moved!  Whoever heard of trees moving? I plucked off  a leaf, turned away, and it had grown back! And the leaf in my hand had doubled in size! I dropped it in horror - and it grew yet more!\n \n At this point the guide told me the truth. This place - Ecologia - was the last known residence of Doktor Dokimi. The infamous Doktor. Yes, the one with all the secrets and hush-hush swirling about.\n \nThen my guide left with the boat. All she said was, 'Back in one week. Beware the Jaberwock.' I have never felt so afraid, so alone. I am no explorer. Yet there in my hands I had a key  - the key to the last known residence of the Doktor. Gods alive!"

local book_text2 = "But where was the house? All I could find, for hours, was an overgrown gravel path beside a stream. Above it - the forest. Moving. Groaning. Growing.\n \nOnly after I had given up did I discover it. Glass, a wall of glass, buried under the tangle of roots. So I dug (me digging!), and I uncovered it. There it was. I was peering into a great glass dome. Entombing the dome was the great unsettling forest.\n \nAnd inside the dome? Two little cottages. So out of place, quaint little thatched cottages. And beside them a peculiar twisting pillar of stone, reaching up to the top of the dome. A stranger sight I have never seen.\n \nAt last inside the dome I entered the main cottage. I could have been at my grandmotherâ€™s house! This was the home of a person who had destroyed an entire world? I felt cheated. Where was the lab? Where was the Doktor? So I searched, everywhere. Nothing. Some old timber in a shed. A toaster. Nothing, except the forest.\n \nBut of course, I felt a fool. How had I got here? Someone had wanted me here. But to what purpose? I did not sleep that night. I did not sleep that week. I could hear the trees moving. I admit, I learnt nothing more in all those days. I did not even write a single poem. Yet every moment I felt as if I had been watched.\n \nDoktor, you have played with me? But why?"
